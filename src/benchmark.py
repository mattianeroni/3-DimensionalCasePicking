This file is part of the implementation of an algorithm for solving the
3-dimensional case picking problem. A newly considered problem of operational
research that combines the routing of pickers into the warehouse, with the
positioning of 3-dimensional items inside pallets (i.e., Pallet Loading Problem).

The algorithm proposed and implemented comes from a collaboration between the
Department of Engineering at University of Parma (Parma, ITALY) and the
IN3 Computer Science Dept. at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Barcelona, SPAIN).

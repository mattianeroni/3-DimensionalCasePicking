# 3-DimensionalCasePicking

A new algorithm for the 3-Dimensional Case Picking Problem. A newly considered problem of operational research that combines the well-known case picking problem with the positioning of 3-dimensional items inside pallets (i.e., Pallet Loading Problem). 


The algorithm proposed and implemented is published on an international scientific journal and comes from a collaboration between the Department of Engineering at University of Parma (Parma, ITALY), the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (UPV), and the IN3 research group in Computer Science Dept. at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Barcelona, SPAIN).
